Here is a list of open source covid-19 datasets:


* COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) is a free resource of 44,000+ research articles about covid-19 and the coronavirus "family" of viruses. It is a dataset curated for data mining and natural language processing (NLP). It is updated weekly.[https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research)

This dataset is also part of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) hosted by the [Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Allen+Institute+For+AI&t=osx)

* NY State has a [county by county breakdown of positive cases](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/county-county-breakdown-positive-cases), which seems to be updated hourly.
