There are many open-source datasets for COVID19 data; some are more curated than others. Here is a list of open source COVID19 datasets:

* The [Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CCSE)](https://systems.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) hosts multiple `csv` files of **cumulative confirmed cases** and **confirmed deaths**.
This project is led by Professor Lauren Gardner in collaboration with Aleksa Zlojutro and David Rey at rCITI at UNSW Sydney, and Ensheng Dong at JHU CSSE.

* [The Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/). This was co-founded in part by _The Atlantic_.

This data can be explored easily on [_The Atlantic_ tracker](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-people-tested-sick-coronavirus-covid-each-state-america/608413/)

* COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) is a free resource of 44,000+ research articles about covid-19 and the coronavirus "family" of viruses. It is a dataset curated for data mining and natural language processing (NLP). It is updated weekly.[https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research)

This dataset is also part of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) hosted by the [Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Allen+Institute+For+AI&t=osx)

* NY State has a [county by county breakdown of positive cases](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/county-county-breakdown-positive-cases), which seems to be updated hourly. However, this data is not in `csv` format
