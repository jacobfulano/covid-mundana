 Yesterday I had my last coffeeshop cup o' joe.

 I was craving some sense of normalcy and walked a few blocks over to Joe's coffee on 120th and Broadway. My sense o' guilt slowly grew with each step. Social distancing is being taken very seriously, and politicians on twitter as well as colleagues on Slack have been beseeching young people avoid public spaces. A friend whatsapped me a humorous not-so-humorous link: [https://www.staythefuckhome.com](www.staythefuckhome.com). The message was clear! And yet.

To make myself feel slightly better - and to have some semblance of control - I donned a single, plastic, surgical glove on my right hand and used it to ceremoniously open all 4 doors I encountered on my journey. I was in a bit of a quandary, though, when it came to finally drinking my cup of coffee. After slinking around the side of the large, airy atrium, and using my credit card with my left hand, I picked up the bright blue disposable cup with my right hand out of habit. The gloved hand.

Well now what? I thought-shouted to myself. Who knows where the barista's hands have been? I wanted to camp out for a few hours and work a bit on my probably not-so-clean laptop. Typing with the glove was out of the question. So was typing with one hand. The cappuccino was too hot and too enjoyable to gulp down. So I removed my glove and carefully wrapped it inside out around the cup. The hygiene acrobatics worked for a bit, but the absurdity of it all slowly dawned on me. I abandoned all precaution and drank the rest of my cup o' joe sans glove.
