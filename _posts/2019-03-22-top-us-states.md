The spread of COVID19 is increasing rapidly across all 50 states. As of 3.22, the states with the most confirmed cases are New Jersey, Washington, California, and New York.

This is the same data but plotted with a different y-axis. New York tragically has many more cases than any other state, and is the center of the epidemic in this country.

## Predictions

#### New Jersey

The prediction is that New Jersey will have close to 15,000 cases by the end of March 27th.

#### New York

I hope that this prediction is a gross overestimate. Fitting an exponential to the data for New York predicts that there will be more than 100,000 cases by the end of March 27th.
