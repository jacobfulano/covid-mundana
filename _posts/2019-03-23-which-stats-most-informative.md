In the early and uncertain stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, it is not clear which statistics are most informative.

While there are many metrics that one can follow, cumulative cases is particularly informative:

* It is a strong indicator of the speed of virus transmission
* We can compare these metrics across countries
* If it becomes less exponential, it means that containment efforts are somewhat helping

TBD
