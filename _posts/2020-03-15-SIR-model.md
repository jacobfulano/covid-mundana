TBD

Kevin Systrom, a co-founder of Instagram, has published a widely-circulated [blogpost about the SIR model.](http://systrom.com/blog/predicting-coronavirus-cases/?mod=article_inline)


This is a great interactive resource based on the SEIR model created by Gabriel Goh from OpenAI: [Coronavirus Calculator](http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html)

UPDATE: It is featured in a NYT Opinion article from March 25, 2020 [Trump Wants to ‘Reopen America.’ Here’s What Happens if We Do.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/25/opinion/coronavirus-trump-reopen-america.html?)
