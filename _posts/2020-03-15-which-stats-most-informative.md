In the early and uncertain stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, it is not clear which statistics are most informative.

While there are many metrics that one can follow, "cumulative cases" is particularly helpful:

* It is a strong indicator of the _speed_ of virus transmission
* We can compare this metric across countries as a baseline
* If it becomes less exponential, it means that containment efforts are somewhat helping

TBD
